# Hello

I'm a software engineer interested in building well-designed, large-scale systems and contributing to impactful projects. I graduated in May 2025 from Columbia University (undergrad), majored in Computer Science.

## Work experience:
- Incoming Full Time Software Engineer @ Amazon (July 2025, New York)
- Software Engineer Intern @ Amazon (Summer 2024, New York)
- Teaching Assistant @ Columbia (multiple semesters, several Physics and Computer Science classes)

## üöÄ Projects/Open-Source Contributions
