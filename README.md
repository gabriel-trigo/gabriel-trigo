## 🚀 Projects/Open-Source Contributions

  Columbia’s course review platform, rebuilt with a modern stack and AWS infrastructure.
  The respository for this project is private, but you can check out [this blog post]() that describes the system design.

  My contributions:
    - Designed and implemented all cloud infrastructure with 100% IaC (AWS CDK). Used CloudFront, EC2, API Gateway, RDS, S3, and CloudWatch. See details in [this blog post]().
    - Added caching to our backend for common classes and professors. This significantly decreased load in our database and improved peak traffic performance a lot.
    - Wrote Github Actions scripts to make testing/deployments automatic. Decreased deployment time from ~1 hour (manual deployments) to < 5 mins (automated deployments).
    - Implemented Professor overview feature, which generates AI overviews for each professor from their reviews with Gemini API. Check out [this blog post]().
